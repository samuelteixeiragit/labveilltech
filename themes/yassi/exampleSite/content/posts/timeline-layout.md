One of Yassi's distinctive features is its timeline-style blog layout. Instead of traditional card grids or simple lists, posts are displayed along a vertical timeline that emphasizes chronology and creates visual interest.

## Visual Design

The timeline features:

- **Vertical line** running down the page
- **Interactive dots** at each post entry
- **Dates positioned** to the left (desktop) or top (mobile)
- **Category badges** for quick filtering
- **Hover effects** that highlight each entry

## Why a Timeline?

The timeline layout offers several advantages:

### Chronological Context

Visitors can immediately see when posts were published and understand the progression of your content over time.

### Visual Interest

The timeline creates a more engaging visual structure compared to traditional blog layouts. The interactive dots and hover effects add subtle interactivity.

### Scannable Content

The consistent structure makes it easy to scan through many posts quickly, while still providing enough information (title, date, summary, categories) to make informed reading choices.

## Responsive Behavior

On desktop screens, the timeline runs down the left side with dates aligned to the left and content flowing to the right.

On mobile devices, the layout adapts:
- Timeline moves closer to the left edge
- Dates appear above the content
- Dots become slightly smaller
- Category badges are hidden to save space

## Interactive Elements

Hover over any post entry to see:
- The timeline dot grows and fills with color
- The post title changes to the theme's accent color
- A subtle slide-right animation

These micro-interactions make browsing more engaging without being distracting.

## Categories and Summaries

Each post displays:
- Publication date
- Reading time estimate
- Post title
- Brief summary (2 lines)
- Category badges (desktop only)

This gives readers enough context to decide which posts interest them most.
